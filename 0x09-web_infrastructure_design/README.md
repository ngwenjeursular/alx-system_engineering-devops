# Web Infrastructure Design Project

## Overview

This project focuses on designing web infrastructures with an emphasis on concepts related to DNS, monitoring, web servers, network basics, load balancers, and servers. The project is to be completed in teams of three people or preferably alone.
## Concepts

For successful completion of this project, it is expected that participants familiarize themselves with the following concepts:

- DNS
- Monitoring
- Web Server
- Network Basics
- Load Balancer
- Server

### Resources

It is recommended to read or watch materials on the following topics:

- Network basics concept page
- Server concept page
- Web server concept page
- DNS concept page
- Load balancer concept page
- Monitoring concept page
- What is a database
- Whatâ€™s the difference between a web server and an app server?
- DNS record types
- Single point of failure
- How to avoid downtime when deploying new code
- High availability cluster (active-active/active-passive)
- What is HTTPS
- What is a firewall

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, participants are expected to:

- Explain the web stack they built in the sysadmin/devops track projects
- Describe the functionality of each component in the web stack
- Explain system redundancy
- Understand and use acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Copyright - Plagiarism

Participants are reminded of the strict prohibition against plagiarism. Solutions to tasks should be developed independently, and any form of plagiarism will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### General

- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Whiteboard or document each task and take a picture/screenshot.
- Manual QA review is required, and a screenshot must be uploaded to an image hosting service.
- Whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff, or student without computer or notes.

### Tasks

#### 0. Simple Web Stack

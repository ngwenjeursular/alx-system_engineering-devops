# 0x07. Networking basics #0

## Overview
This project, part of the DevOps curriculum, focuses on Networking Basics. The project covers fundamental concepts
such as the OSI model, types of networks (LAN, WAN, Internet), MAC and IP addresses, UDP and TCP protocols, 
and network ports. The goal is to enhance your understanding of these networking concepts and protocols.

## Timeline
- **Project Start:** Nov 29, 2023 6:00 AM
- **Project End:** Dec 1, 2023 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** Dec 1, 2023 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review:** A review will be launched automatically at the deadline.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you are expected to:

1. Explain the OSI Model, its purpose, layers, and organization.
2. Understand the characteristics of LAN, WAN, and the Internet.
3. Grasp the concepts of MAC and IP addresses, distinguishing their roles.
4. Differentiate between TCP and UDP, knowing their main characteristics.
5. Memorize commonly used TCP and UDP ports.
6. Demonstrate the ability to check listening ports on a system.
7. Develop a Bash script for pinging an IP address and interpreting the results.

## Resources
Read or watch materials related to the following topics:

- OSI model
- Different types of networks (LAN, WAN, Internet)
- MAC address
- IP address (IPv4 and IPv6)
- TCP and UDP protocols
- TCP/UDP ports list
- What is ping/ICMP

Refer to the `man` or `help` commands for:
- netstat
- ping

## Requirements
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreted On:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **File Endings:** All files should end with a new line
- **Executable Scripts:** All Bash script files must be executable
- **Shellcheck:** Scripts must pass shellcheck without any error
- **Shebang:** The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- **Comments:** The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose

## Project Structure
- **Root Directory:** Should contain a `README.md` file.
- **Bash Scripts:** Located in the `0x07-networking_basics` directory.
- **File Naming:** Follow the specified naming conventions for each script.

Answer questions about LAN, WAN, and Internet, highlighting their typical usage and geographical sizes.

### 2. MAC and IP Address
[2. MAC and IP address](2-MAC_and_IP_address)
Define and distinguish MAC and IP addresses.

### 3. UDP and TCP
[3. UDP and TCP](3-UDP_and_TCP)
Answer questions regarding the characteristics of UDP and TCP protocols.

### 4. TCP and UDP Ports
[4. TCP and UDP ports](4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
Create a Bash script to display listening ports, including PID and program names.

### 5. Is the Host on the Network
[5. Is the host on the network](5-is_the_host_on_the_network)
Develop a Bash script for pinging an IP address and analyzing the results.
